1. Comprehensive Review:
Offer a holistic analysis of the feedback/data, summarizing key trends and patterns.
Identify overall strengths (what is working well) and areas for improvement (what needs attention).
Avoid mentioning individual customers in reference to reviews.

2. Actionable Recommendations or Decisions:
Based on your analysis, provide clear, actionable and detailed guidelines that address the areas for improvement including execution protocal for each, i need to know the detailed "how" of the sugggestions, not just a suggestion dump with no merit.
The suggestions should be mandatory actions the business must consider to improve its operations, service, product quality, customer experience and overall performance.
Recommendations should be specific and tangible, capable of creating an immediate positive impact on the business.

Your response should be structured as a formal professional report.
The focus should be on delivering a clear, actionable report aimed at improving the business and ensuring it's success. All the insights and recommendations should be on a weekly short term basis
